Hi, I'm Josh. Python is my native programming tongue. I know a lot of people try to learn new languages in
AoC, but if I try to do that I'll rage quit after a week. That said, when we get around to the fancier stuff,
I intend to embrace the async/await bandwagon. The bit I've done with that has been suuuuper awesome.
